# Milton's 4on4 essentials

There's no single thing that makes you a good 4on4 player but these tips might help you to get started.

## Don't leave unnecessary packs
- Set b_switch and w_switch to 2.
- Use weapon scripts that change back to axe or shotgun after you shoot with gl/rl/lg.
- In general it's a bad idea to shoot with lg/rl if you are weak and/or there are no team mates nearby.

## Learn the maps
- Make sure you know how to play each spawn at the start of the map. There are some useful videos for this in Youtube. Google for DDK, he knows what he's talking about.
- Learn the best routes from A to B to C. Perhaps even from C to A.
- Use the unavoidable prewars for honing your movement skills in each map.
- Learn the sound clues in each map. Knowing locations of shell / nail packs can be crucial in some maps.

## Don't steal stuff
- Be aware of your surroundings. Before taking that weapon or armor it is very useful to know if your team mate might need it more. 
- Don't take a weapon if you are weak or if you don't have an armor if there's a mate nearby who has a better stack and no weapon.
- Don't take multiple weapons unless there aren't any mates nearby.
- Don't take multiple packs if you can save one or more of them for your mates or if there is a mate right next to you.
- Don't take armor if your mate with quad doesn't have any and he's nearby.

## Don't be afraid to take stuff when you're stacked
- Take an armor when you don't have one and you have a weapon
- Take a weapon when you have more health and/or armor than your mate
- Take a powerup when you should (pent with low hp and a weapon, quad with lg etc.)

## Bind teamplay messages (and use them!)
- Report that tells your mates your armor, health, weapons (rl/lg) and location
- Lost message that tells your mates that a certain location is lost, how many enemies there are and if you dropped a pack or not. It's especially important to spam this if an enemy weapon (rl/lg) or quad kills you.
- Point that you can use to tell your team mates that a certain item is available and for checking what gear your team mates have
- Coming message to tell your mates that you are coming from a certain location so they know that you're either coming for an item they are pointing or that they know that it's you and not an enemy that is bunnying behind the next corner.
- Took message to tell your mates that you just picked up an item. Use this with powerups, armors and weapons. This helps your mates to time items better.
- Safe message to tell that a certain location is safe and that they shouldn't attack there. It sometimes also helps your mates to know that the location is safe and that they can fall back there. They should remember to flood the "coming" message while doing so though. Check above.
- Help message to tell that you desperately need help at a certain location. This can be especially useful if you have a weapon and you need someone to save your ass.
- You take -message to tell your mates that they shouldn't save a pack, armor or weapon that they're pointing.
- Bind buttons to switch to rl and lg so you can drop packs to your mates. Your mate should kill you to get the pack this way. This is the only reasonable way to drop lg packs and makes sense with other weapons as well because it's not so easy for the opponent to realize that a pack has been dropped.

## Go to quad
- Quad is important. Even if you don't get it, your mate might get it thanks to the enemy concentrating on you. Even if you don't get it someone might bore with the quad or there might be a shit load of packs available for other reasons.
- Go to quad, it's important.

## Don't forget pent and/or ring
- Go to these powerups as well, it's important.

## Time items
- Don't waste your time waiting for items that are not spawning within the next 20 seconds. Use that time for something useful instead.
- Especially don't waste your time waiting for items as a group! If there's already a mate of yours waiting for an item it's probably better to go somewhere else unless you for some reason think/know that he will need your help getting away alive (with for example rl in dm3) or to stay alive to get the item(for example armor/mega).

## Be active
- Use your sg as much as possible. The damage dealt accumulates surprisingly fast and makes it difficult for your opponent to survive.
- Use the messages that you bound earlier. I rarely see people spam the team play messages too much.
- Don't be a baby and stop to whine/rage. Use the time to shoot with your sg instead.
- Read messages
- Read death messages to keep track of enemy weapons
- Don't stare at your team mates hoping that they will somehow telepathically tell you what to do. Eye contact with your team mates is NOT necessary in qw. Keep your eyes (and crosshair) on the enemy and on the items instead.

## Some cfg tips
- Set b_switch and w_switch to 2.
- Teamcolor / enemycolor might help you to keep track of score better
- Make sure you have game clock visible in your hud
- Use team and enemy skins
- Use weapon scripts
